COMPARE BETWEEN WEIGHTCLASSES:
  (run a separate analysis for females?)
  (combine female fights?)
  (compare past and modern era)
      Claim: heavier weightclasses are more exciting
        1)  Investigate: Is there a sig difference between weightclasses in sig strikes landed per min?
              -sig strikes landed per min
              -TKO/KOs
              -finishes
              -

        2) Use the different in fight metrics (strike output/td attempts/kd). How about charting a trend for each fights), then averaging all metrics for each fight (hmmm, dodgy) and then averaging for all fights for that weightclass?

      Claim: fighters in higher weightclasses gas faster
        3) Investigate: look at differences between weightclasses for striking/takedown attempt output? (

COMPARE BETWEEN TIME PERIODS
        4) Investigate: Are there more finishes(KO/TKO/Submissions/Doctor Stoppages/Corner stoppage) in the older eras
          (plot trend of finishes over the years)
          (plot trend of decisions over the years)

        5) Check (r) the strength of correlation between age and ...
          -num of fights
          -num of ufc fights

        6)  Claim: "MMA is a young person sport."
            Investigate: Do younger fighters have higher win-ratios?
              (get the stats of fighters before their fights)
